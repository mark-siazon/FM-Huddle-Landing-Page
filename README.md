## Overview:

### The challenge:

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and a tiny bit of JavaScript.**
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- Get it looking as close to the design as possible.
- See a hover state on desktop
